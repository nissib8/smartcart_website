SmartCart
Overview

SmartCart is a web based platform designed to simplify online shopping by allowing users to explore the same product across multiple e commerce platforms at the same time. Instead of manually switching between different websites to compare prices, ratings, and reviews, SmartCart brings all this information together in one unified interface. The goal of the platform is to help users make smarter and more informed purchasing decisions with less effort and time.

Problem Statement

Online shoppers often face the challenge of comparing products across multiple platforms such as different marketplaces and retail websites. Each platform may offer different prices, ratings, reviews, delivery options, and discounts for the same product. Manually navigating through each website is time consuming, repetitive, and inefficient. This often leads to rushed decisions or missed better deals.

Solution

SmartCart addresses this problem by enabling users to search for a product once and view its availability across multiple platforms simultaneously. The platform aggregates product details from various sources and presents them in a clear and structured format. Users can easily compare prices, customer ratings, and reviews side by side, making it easier to identify the best option based on their preferences.
